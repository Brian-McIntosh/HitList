# HitList
A simple table view using Core Data

* Prefers Large Titles

* Without using a NavigationController, we recreated that functionality in code with custom CATransition(s).

* Did this in an Extension of the UIViewController class

* App Folder Structure
* Binding Views to the Keyboard to Prevent Hiding
* Enabling Editing of TableView Rows!
